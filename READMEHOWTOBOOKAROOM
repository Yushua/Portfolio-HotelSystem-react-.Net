ROoms can be booked one way. you clikc a room. check the date that you arrive and leave.

each booking then becomes its own entity with that date, BUT it needs to be told to the room itself
when that room is booked. that data is send to the frontend.

the issue is this. that requires to changes. the room itself and the new booking. because if a room is booked
but then cancelled, one should be able to book that room again.

!Important
bOokings are done per day. not per period. you can't book a room for half a day. you book a room for the full day.
thats jsut for now.Each booking starts at 10. at 9 the previous owners leave. so the room is based on 23 hours.

So these steps

one.

you get the room Data, inside of it, it shows the days that you can apply to.
so this needs to be readable enough that the frondend can showcase it.

search a room. search the date you want a booking.

book a room. you send the begindate and endDate to the room. if this works then this new date period is added
to the room AND the Booking is made. each roomEntity can see all the bookings it has made. a function is made to pull it
all together showing the dates it is occupied.


so these function

all rooms are returned, this doesn't need to be... done like that
got to think, do I give out all the dates that a room is occupied? should the costumer know? maybe so. either way
this data is with AllRoomsData.

CheckoomDateOccupied(roomId, beginDate, EndDate);

this checks if the room can be booked.

BookRoom(user, roomId, BeginDate, EndDate); creates a new booking thats added to the room

RemoveBooking(User); //cancel

check if the user.id is the owner of the hotel of the booking OR if its the user that booked it.
when you cancle. it first looks if you are either the OWNER of the hotel OR the OWNER of the booking

a booking can be removed if its Endate is there. however, this can be pushed by the Owner at the start of the week.
automated system to do things on the website? maybe?
